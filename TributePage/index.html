        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Yuan Longping (Chinese: 袁隆平; pinyin: Yuán Lóngpíng; September 7,
            1930 – May 22, 2021) was a Chinese agronomist and inventor. He was a
            member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering known for developing
            the first hybrid rice varieties in the 1970s, part of the Green
            Revolution in agriculture.[1] For his contributions, Yuan is known
            as the "Father of Hybrid Rice".[2][3] Hybrid rice has since been
            grown in dozens of countries in Africa, America, and Asia—boosting
            food security and providing a robust food source in areas with a
            high risk of famine. The technology allowed China to sustain 20% of
            the global population on 9% of global arable land, an achievement in
            food security where he was awarded the 2004 World Food Prize and the
            2004 Wolf Prize in Agriculture respectively.
